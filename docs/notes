Issue : How to use docker compose?
Good thing is I have used vagrant so, even tough I haven't used Docker I have an idea of how it works
    1.  Went trought the docker docs and installed Docker and Docker compose
        For Docker : https://docs.docker.com/install/#server
        https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
        Followed the steps in the documentation, was straightforward
        For Docker componse : https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

    2.  Went trought the docs to see how to setup the env for the challenge
        https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/#step-4-build-and-run-your-app-with-compose
        Error while trying to run docker compose:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44800484/docker-couldnt-connect-to-docker-daemon-at-httpdocker-localunixsocket-is-i#45528428
        Tried building the image by hand with docker instead of docker-compose
        "Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at"
        There was a permission issue with the Docker daemon because my user was not automatically added to the docker group
        Ran docker-compose up again and the build works this time

    3.  How to fix the network issues?
        I need to understand docker config first : https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/
        
        I need to set the nginx to be exposed on localhost:8080 and forward the requests to the API
        As I haven't used nginx in a while and I'm not 100% familiar with Docker config I used this medium post as a reference:
